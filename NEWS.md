### 0.5.9

Added kwarg argument `format` to the `readtimearray` method to allow parsing datetime formats that are not 
currently supported.

Changed two references to `Range1` to `UnitRange`

Added import of Base.values. I had defined it first and I guess they like it so much they co-opted it. :)

### pre-0.5.8

Not currently documented.
